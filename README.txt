*******************************************************************************

word_ladder_BST is a Word Ladder program using a txt file for the dictionary.
The program uses a binary search tree to find assosiated words which then 
builds a ladder from a staring word to an ending word of the same lenght with
each word in the ladder having at least one letter in common with the last word. 

********************************************************************************

BST_Linked_List is similar to word_ladder_BST program but this time it is 
building a binary tree structure with a linked list pointing to two child
nodes. The programs first builds the data struct using a linked list then
it looks for appropriate words to build the ladders. The reason why i build
a binary tree structure is to decrease the run time of the program.
